# Resources

Here are some general resources for learning the material. I will list out the texts used for each section though I do not necessarily follow them exactly. I will also include some supplemental resources and reading material as well as many open source and free options. 

# General Resources

Here are some good general resources for many of the subjects covered in this project. 

* [MIT OpenCourseWare]()
    * An absolutely fantastic resource for just about any math or physics subject. Entire courses with lectures, slides, lecture notes, problem sets etc. 
* [Khan Academy]()
    * Great for introductory math and physics. This could be used to learn most of the mathematical material starting from wherever your mathematical knowledge up through Calculus 3 (vector calculus).

# Primary (and supplemental) Textbooks

The primary textbook for each course is the text that I personally used. Supplemental texts are either texts that I have read through somewhat or come highly recommended by friends or colleagues of mine.

## General Physics Texts

The general physics classes that every undergraduate physics student must take are:

* Introductory Mechanics
* Introductory Electrostatics
* Modern Physics
* Classical Mechanics
* Electrodynamics
* Quantum Mechanics
* Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics

Here I will list out the textbooks that I have used either as a primary textbook for a course or as a reference for that course. The first three courses, Introductory Mechanics, Introductory Electromagnetism, and Modern Physics use the same book.

### Introductory Mechanics

This is the first physics course that any university student takes. Usually taken within the first 2 semesters. 

* Primary Textbook: 
    * University Physics with Modern Physics by Young and Freedman 
* Supplementary Texts
    * Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday and Resnick

There are many other introductory physics textbooks but I have no experience with them and so will not list them here. These two are the standard university textbooks for the first 2 or 3 physics classes in a university and for good reason. They are both very clear and explain things in a nice intuitive way. 

### Introductory Electrostatics

After taking introductory mechanics students will take an introductory electromagnetism course. This course covers the basics of electricity and magnetism which will then be developed further in later courses. This course finishes with learning about Maxwell's equations and deriving the speed of light. 

* Primary Textbook: 
    * University Physics with Modern Physics by Young and Freedman 
* Supplementary Texts
    * Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday and Resnick

### Modern Physics

Here students will learn the basics about some more modern physics ideas. They will learn a bit about Optics, Quantum Mechanics, Special Relativity, and a few other topics. 

* Primary Textbook: 
    * University Physics with Modern Physics by Young and Freedman 

Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday and Resnick does not have modern physics chapters as of this writing so just stick to Young and Freedman for this. 

### Classical Mechanics

Here is where we really start to learn physics. This class does away with many of the simplifying assumptions made in the introductory mechanics class such as air resistance, you learn to solve some more difficult problems with more degrees of freedom, and you learn about the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics which will be incredibly useful in later classes. Many of the problems encountered in this class may not have analytical solutions so approximations are the only real way to solve them. You learn a lot about differential equations and how to apply and solve them. 

* Primary Textbook
    * Classical Mechanics by Taylor
* Supplementary Texts
    * Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems by Thornton and Marion

### Classical Electrodynamics

More exploration of Maxwell's equations and other topics in E&M.

* Primary Textbook
    * Introduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths

This is really the only book you need for this course. Griffiths is an incredible author who makes things clear and intuitive.

### Quantum Mechanics

### Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics

## Additional Physics Subjects

There are many different areas of physics to study. So many in fact that no one person could study all of physics. Here I have listed some additional classes and references for these subjects. Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of the possible subjects. If I have studied the material I will list the books or resources that I used.

* Mathematical Physics
* Fourier Transform
* Special and General Relativity
* Quantum Computing
* Computational Physics
* Astronomy / Astrophysics

### Special and General Relativity

Einstein's theories of Special and General Relativity are fascinating subjects that can really alter the way you think about the world. Special Relativity is mathematically not very difficult but conceptually can twist your brain into knots. General Relativity on the other hand is an extremely difficult subject both mathematically and conceptually. Many GR textbooks assume no prior knowledge of differential geometry and manifolds but I would *highly* recommend going through a differential geometry text before diving into GR. Some books for differential geometry are:

* Tensor Calculus for Physics by Dwight E. Neuenschwander
* Differential Geometry of Curves & Surfaces by Manfredo P. Do Carmo

Once you have the basics of differential geometry down then you can start looking into General Relativity with the following books:

* Gravity by James B. Hartle
* Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity by Sean Carroll
* Gravitation by Charles W. Misner
