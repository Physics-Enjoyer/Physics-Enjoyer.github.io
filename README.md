# Introduction

```{python}
print("Hello world!)
```

Hello world! I am a physics graduate student studying computational physics. If you have somehow managed to stumble upon this site know this. It is *very* incomplete. It is currently really just a repository for my notes for classes that I am taking or for my research. Sometimes when working on my research or homework or something I want to look up my notes from previous classes and honestly that is a pain. So I created this as a place to store my notes for when I want to look something up. This is a new project so it currently only has the classes I am taking (and not even all of them) and so far none of my research is present. I just finished up a paper that should hopefully be published soon and am currently in between projects. Once I start on a new project I hope to add it here. 

Well, I guess that's it for now. Everything here is under construction so if something doesn't work sorry. Let me know and I'll try to fix it.

## My Physics Notes

Ever since I took my first Physics course I have been disappointed with the methods of teaching physics at university. This is in no way the fault of the professors I have had. In fact, I think that my professors have been great and have done a great job of teaching complicated material to students. But physics is still taught out of a textbook. Which is fine honestly, I love textbooks and have a small collection of them many of which I use often for reference material. But at university they often provide links to the textbook to read online or provide a PDF of the material. Like just about anyone nowadays I read on my phone a lot or want to look something up. However the format of textbooks online is abysmal to read on anything smaller than the largest tablet. So I have decided to transfer my notes in a format that is easy to navigate, easy to read on both computers or phones, and something that I can reference whenever and wherever I want. 

Aside from the difficulty of referencing my notes or books for certain material I also want to give these notes some interactivity. Interactivity allows the user to change things and see what happens, it provides more intuition about the concepts being learned if one has the ability to interact with the learning environment. 

Much of these notes are also a way for me to practice physics and computer programming. The notes themselves are are all written in Jupyter Notebooks with some computational aspects included. Then i use the [jupyter {book}](www.jupyterbook.org) project to convert the notebook files into html. 

All below are a work in progress:

[Classical Mechanics](https://physics-enjoyer.github.io/classical_mechanics/intro.html) \
[Electrodynamics](https://Physics-Enjoyer.github.io/electrodynamics) 
<!-- [Spectral Analysis](https://Physics-Enjoyer.github.io/spectral_analysis) \
[Machine Learning](https://Physics-Enjoyer.github.io/machine_learning) -->

## Resources 

There are many great resources available online already for learning physics which can be found on the [Resources](resources.md) page.

<!-- TODO: Add a list of classes in order I want to do

phys 1
phys 2
...
Electrydynamics
SPectral Analysis
Machine Learning -->

<!--- 
TODO: add this ::: 
A very good knowledge of calculus in one and multiple variables is needed, as well as linear algebra: basis, vectors, change of basis, diagonalization, eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This is the basic which is needed to understand basic physics concepts of classical mechanics and ED; further mathematical methods will be taught during the courses and will be needed to (try to) understand qm and approach qft in eventual major studies and differential equations
